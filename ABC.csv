 We have taken our annual 2,833 crores which marks a year-and-a-dump of 36,000 page.  The country has taken a total balance of 5,282 crores with a burden of spending of 2,566 crores.  In this research, we have acquired over 1,000 customers in one quarter which has to have a customer base to maintain  pipelines for 5,000 for the first time. The PBT of the company sold at 17,29 crores taking our share holders thanks to 662.12 crores.  Talking about the DMT of the company, wherein Q2 ended in Q2 end, we have taken a very conscious call of turning out one more pre-credit NPA pool or a back field to ARC.  Therein also even after that the DMT of the company is standing at 4.73%, the NMP of the company standing at 2.22%.  Just to give you a brief on that NMP as well, wherein we have also specified in the notes as well, wherein we have done the first ARC of the company with Phoenix ARC,  wherein our major pool of the company has been sold to ARC which was a pre-coded pool back field.  After that we have revised our PCR norms making it a 75% page.  Then after immediately selling the second pool to ARC, wherein we have again further revised those names.
